# Online-Voting-System
A secure Spring Boot REST API for online voting with JWT authentication and role-based access. Admins manage candidates, assign voters, and view real-time results; voters cast one vote during the active election window. Ensures data validation, prevention of duplicate voting, and secure, time-limited elections.
